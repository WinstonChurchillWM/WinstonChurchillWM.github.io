<h2>The Draft</h2>
<p>
Patrick Mahomes was selected 10th Overall by the Kansas City Chiefs. 
He was projected as a 2nd round pick due to his poor footwork and decision making.
He was regarded as being drafted high due to the likes of Mitchell Trubisky, Deshaun Watson, and Deshone Kizer in the same draft class. 
As <i>Sports Illustrated</i> reports, Andy Reid gave the current GM, Mike Veach, a full approval of Patrick.  
Andy Reid, one of the best offensive minds, gives quaterbacks rigorous tests of skill and football knowledge.
Patrick passed the test, and as a result he was the Chief's first pick in the 2017 draft.
