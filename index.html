"Winston Churchill was one of the best-known, and some say one of the greatest, 
statesmen of the 20th century. Though he was born into a life of privilege, he 
dedicated himself to public service. His legacy is a complicated one: He was an idealist 
and a pragmatist; an orator and a soldier; an advocate of progressive social reforms 
and an unapologetic elitist; a defender of democracy – especially during World War II – as 
well as of Britain’s fading empire. But for many people in Great Britain and elsewhere, 
Winston Churchill is simply a hero." - History.com

<h2>1st Person Biography</h2>
<p>
“Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.” You may know me
by that quote, but if not, I am hard-headed, cold-hearted when necessary, and a relentless commander. I was a 
soldier stationed in India, the Suez Canal, and South Africa. I was a journalist, an author of 7 books containing 
my war experiences and life and a profound statesman. I enjoy painting, sports, and history. I am less commonly 
known as the inventor of the tank and as a stonemason. While Prime Minster of England during World War Two, I 
was the commander of Operation Dunkirk, the campaign to rescue British troops from Nazi-invaded France. I rallied 
my troops during the Battle of Britain while simultaneously inspiring my people. I met with my allies, Roosevelt 
and Stalin, however badly I disagreed with them. My speeches were described as being “worth an army”, and my most 
famous speech was the “Iron Curtain” speech orated at Fulton, Missouri. I knew the Cold War was coming! I aided 
in the creation of the United Nations to gradually work towards world peace and unity. I am Winston Churchill.

<h2>Churchill and His Speeches</h2>
<p>
Churchill gave many speeches throughout his career that influenced and inspired many people. 
He even gave speeches to Americans before they even entered the war. 
Perhaps his most memorable, and many debate most important, is his "Their Finest Hour".
This speech was given to inspire everyone around the world, and to inspire them to stand up to the Nazis. 
One exerpt from the speech is: "What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin...
Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war. 
If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.
But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for,
will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.
Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that, 
if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.'"
